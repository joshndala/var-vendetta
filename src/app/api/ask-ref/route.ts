    response: `Based on the audio recordings you've shared, I've analyzed the player mistakes in question.

The first incident at 02:14 appears to be a poor first touch from the striker that allowed the defender to intercept what should have been a clear goal-scoring opportunity. The player needed to keep the ball closer to their feet while maintaining forward momentum.

The second incident at 07:36 shows a midfielder making a risky back pass that was nearly intercepted. This is a common mistake under pressure - the player should have looked for a safer passing option or cleared the ball when uncertain.

The third incident at 15:22 demonstrates poor positioning by the defender who was caught ball-watching instead of tracking their runner. This fundamental error created space for the opposition to exploit in a dangerous area.

Overall, these mistakes show a pattern of decision-making errors under pressure. I'd recommend focusing training sessions on quick decision-making drills and maintaining composure in the final third.

Would you like me to suggest specific training exercises to address these issues?`,
